# Garp3: Qualitative Reasoning & Modelling

This repo contains a copy of the sources found at
https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/tcs/QRgroup/QRM/software/, ported to SWI-Prolog
8.

Note that _porting_ just means fixing a few problems that prevented
loading. The port was done on SWI-Prolog 8.1.28, but most likely applies
to all versions of SWI-Prolog starting from 8.0.

__Note:__ the functionality of this version has not been tested.
