			menu input
			----------

At the > prompt, GARP expects input of a single option. At the >> prompt
one or more options are expected, separated by white space.

At any prompt a shell command, preceded by a ! is possible. After
execution the menu is redrawn.

Often only a list of options is presented. Entering a ? will result
in a full description of those options.


The main menu is preceded by an optional diagram of parameter values
for selected parameters and a state-transition table.

The visible parameters can be selected with the 'tv' (toggle visible) option.

			-------------
			value diagram
			-------------

A value diagram shows for all states the parameters quantity space,
the value of the parameter and the direction in which the value is
changing. A typical diagram is:

pressure(water1)
/ \  / \  / \
|-|  | |  | |  plus
| |  | |  | |  
[ ]  [?]  [ ]  zero
| |  | |  | |  
| |  | |  |0|  min
\ /  \ /  \ /  

 1    2    3

meaning: the pressure of system element water1 is plus and decreasing
in state 1, zero and not influenced in state 2 and min and not changing
in state 3. A point interval is represented as [ ]. Intervals between
two points, extending to plus/min infinity are represented resp. as:

| |	/ \	| |
| |	| |	| |
| |	| |	\ /


			----------------------
			State-transition table
			----------------------

The transition table shows states (columns) and transitions between
states (rows).


Transition table symbols:

	+	The transition has status terminated
		( transition rules have been applied on its state )
	=	The transition has status ordered
		( precedence rules have been applied on its state )
	o---->	The transition is closed
		( a transition to another state was found )
	*---->	The transition is closed
		( the transition is to the state itself and to another state)
	x	No transition to another state was found as a result
		of applying the ordered termination

A state number is followed by a ! if the transition to another state
is immediate.

			-----------------
			Main menu options
			-----------------

Except for the actions explained below, the following options are possible:

-	One or more state numbers:
		leads to a menu for the actions
		-	show
		-	terminate
		-	order
		-	close
		-	undo terminations 
		on the indicated states.

-	A transition
		shows the transition
		if it is ordered, a close option is possible
		if it is closed a undo close option is possible.

Closing a state will close all ordered transitions.
Closing a transtion will close that transtion only.
The actions terminate and order are only possible for one or more states.
The undo termination option sets the status of the termination back
to ordered and removes successor states if they have no other predecessors.

Labeled main menu options:

	ACTIONS

new	choose a new input model and compute all its interpetations
all	terminate, order and close all states and any successor
ta	terminate all interpreted states
oa	order all terminated states
ca	close all ordered states
cs	redo the syntactic and partial semantic check on the
	system structure library (which is done automatically when
	reading the library)
ci	idem for the input systems
q	quit

	SAVE/LOAD

s	save current state
	a file is created that contains all necessary information for
	proceeding from the current state. However, this is not
	a save of the complete memory state. The user must make sure
	that the same library files are loaded when proceeding.
l	load a previously saved state

	SHOW

sa	show all: (some items of) each state description
sl	show library: one or more system structures
si	show input system: one or more input systems
hi	show isa hierarchy
hs	show system structures isa hierarchy
ha	show system structures 'applies to' hierarchy
	( or consists_of )
tv	toggle parameter values shown preceding the main menu
table	show selected parameter values and the state-transiton table
	the major difference with the same action that precedes
	the main menu is, that it is appended to a protocol (if active)
	and shown through the pager
o	toggle trace options (for the various tasks)

	EDIT

el	edit library. A menu asks to choose a system structure.
	If your favourite editor is top (emacs?) it will find that
	system structure in file: your_libraray/library
ei	edit input sytem. As edit library. (file: your_library/input_system)
es	edit semantic network (file: your_library/isa)
er	edit rules for determining state transformation
	(file: your_library/rules)

	PROTOCOL

p	protocol on. A non existing file protocolX is created.
	Except for the menus, any output is also written to that file,
	including the output normally shown by a pager.
	This is different from normal prolog protocolling.
np	protocol off.
